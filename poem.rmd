The moonlight drapes the silent sea,  
A silver song, a melody.  
It hums to waves that kiss the sand,  
A love affair, so softly planned.  
  
The stars lean close to hear the tale,  
Of drifting boats with tattered sail.  
The night wind sighs in gentle tune,  
A whispered vow beneath the moon.  
  
The trees, they dance in quiet grace,  
Their shadows swayed in night's embrace.  
A lonely owl in distant flight,  
Calls out a hymn to wake the night.  
  
And in this hush of silver glow,  
A dreamer's heart begins to grow.  
For in the dark, where echoes run,  
Lies hope reborn with each new sun.
